The primary focus of \r\nthe framework is to provide a maintainable means of creating test for HTTP web applications and services. You can view more info about the idea behind test pipe on the [Concepts](https://github.com/charleslbryant/TestPipe/wiki/Concepts) page in the wiki.\r\n\r\nCurrent Version\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nThe current version of TestPipe is 1.0.0. It isn't indicated in the version \r\nnumber, but this is a preview. It hasn't been fully tested against a production \r\napplication, so use at your own risk.\r\n\r\nDownload\r\n--------\r\n\r\nTestPipe source code is hosted at https://github.com/charleslbryant/TestPipe. \r\n\r\nTestPipe binaries are hosted on Nuget.org. The packages are versioned individually and may differ from the TestPipe Framework version.\r\n\r\nThese are the TestPipe packages hosted on NuGet:\r\n\r\n- https://www.nuget.org/packages/TestPipe\r\n  This package provides the binaries, config, and folder structure for writing TestPipe tests in a single TestPipe project.\r\n- https://www.nuget.org/packages/TestPipe.Specs\r\n  This package provides the binaries, config, and folder structure for writing TestPipe tests in a separate TestPipe Specs project.\r\n- https://www.nuget.org/packages/TestPipe.Pages\r\n  This package provides the binaries for modeling the pages and controls you want to test in a separate TestPipe Pages project.\r\n\r\nWe also host some of the individual parts on NuGet, but they are not visible in NuGet search and are not meant to be used outside of experimentation. If you find them or are using them, it is recommended that you use the packages above or download the source code.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nTo install TestPipe you can install the NuGet packages or download the source \r\ncode and build and reference the binaries.
