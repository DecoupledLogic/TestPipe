TestPipe is an Automated Test Framework written with C#. The primary focus of 
the framework is to provide a maintainable means of creating test for HTTP web applications and services. You can view more info about the idea behind test pipe on the [Concepts](https://github.com/charleslbryant/TestPipe/wiki/Concepts) page in the wiki.

Current Version
---------------

The current version of TestPipe is 1.0.0. It isn't indicated in the version 
number, but this is a preview. It hasn't been fully tested against a production 
application, so use at your own risk.

Download
--------

TestPipe source code is hosted at https://github.com/charleslbryant/TestPipe. 

TestPipe binaries are hosted on Nuget.org. The packages are versioned individually and may differ from the TestPipe Framework version.

These are the TestPipe packages hosted on NuGet:

- https://www.nuget.org/packages/TestPipe
  This package provides the binaries, config, and folder structure for writing TestPipe tests in a single TestPipe project.
- https://www.nuget.org/packages/TestPipe.Specs
  This package provides the binaries, config, and folder structure for writing TestPipe tests in a separate TestPipe Specs project.
- https://www.nuget.org/packages/TestPipe.Pages
  This package provides the binaries for modeling the pages and controls you want to test in a separate TestPipe Pages project.

We also host some of the individual parts on NuGet, but they are not visible in NuGet search and are not meant to be used outside of experimentation. If you find them or are using them, it is recommended that you use the packages above or download the source code.
